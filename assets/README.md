# Icon Files Required

This folder needs to contain the following icon files:

1. **icon.png** - For display in the application UI (recommended size: 32x32 or 64x64 pixels)
2. **icon.ico** - For Windows EXE icon and application icon (should contain multiple sizes: 16x16, 32x32, 48x48, 256x256)

The icon should be a blue square/diamond shape with a white hash symbol (#) in the center, matching the design described.

Please place both files in this `assets/` directory before building the application.
